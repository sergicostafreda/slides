# Slides Project Context

This project implements a simple HTML/CSS slide deck system.

- Entry point: index.html
- Decks are in the `decks/` folder.
- `template.html` is the base template for all decks.
- Shared styling lives in `assets/styles.css`.

Conventions:
- All slides should inherit styling from `template.html`.
- Colours and design are controlled only via `assets/styles.css`.
